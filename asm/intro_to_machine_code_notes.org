* Introduction to Assembly:

** Disassembling C code with GDB
C files must be compiled with the -g flag in gcc in order to be analyzed with gdb.
Once you have done this call the executable file with gdb

Example:

gdb a.out

*** List Source Code
Once you have the program running in GDB there are several options:

list or l: will list the program's source code defaults to 10 lines
additional options such as specifying a function name or the line number with first,last are possible

set listsize <count>: will change the default number of lines
list +: lists the next set of lines
list -: lists the last set of lines
*** Set Breakpoints 
You can set a breakpoint with
break <linenumber>: alternatively just b
or you can simply call the name of the function as an argument
b myfunc
*** Curses Based Debugging
You start curses based debugging with tui e or alternatively run gdb as gdb -tui
